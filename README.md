# global-superstore-profit-analysis

1. Overview / Introduction

This is my first end-to-end data analysis project where I combined Python (for data exploration) and Power BI (for business visualization). The goal was to analyze profitability within the Global Superstore dataset and gain actionable insights. It helped me practice both technical tools and business thinking.Although this was my first project even before embarking on this project i was feeling reluctant cuz i was unsure about the entire process , even though i've been learning and practicing data analysis's various tools for the last half year, and now i'm feeling a lil self assured , for future i'm wishing myself All the best for creating even more complex and robust project.

2. Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- DAX
- GitHub


3. Project Structure

üìÅ notebooks/ ‚Üí Jupyter-based EDA and data cleaning  
üìÅ data/ ‚Üí Cleaned dataset used in Power BI  
üìÅ powerbi/ ‚Üí Final Power BI report (.pbix)


4. Key Insights / What You Discovered

I began with using a random dataset from kaggle, when i uploaded it on jupyter notebook , i fiured it was cleaned and therefore i simulated few errors into it , then mend them leveraging various techniquies , using pandas , and now it was turn of performing eda , i wondered why i was visualizing everything then i questioned that what would i do in data visualization phase , ultimately i got to know during eda we explore data fix issues initally by visualizing things , right after eda i transitioned towards analyzing things through displaying them on charts and graph and successfully pinpoint the insights , patterns and the driving force behind.

5. How to Use / View

- Clone the repository
- Open the Jupyter notebook inside `notebooks/` to explore EDA
- Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to view the dashboard

6. Personal Reflection

This project helped me connect the dots between data processing and business storytelling. It was both challenging and rewarding, especially translating raw data into actionable insights using Power BI.
